In order to make the 16-bit RISC Processor run its simulation, it is necessary to change the filepath location from four different modules. 

The first module is the Instruction Memory, The Data Memory, the parameter, and the Testbench.

You just need to change the location up until /test.data, /test.prog, /50001111_50001212.o, and /Parameter.v

These files can be found under /.srcs/sources_1/new

You can change the values of test.data and test.prog as you wish to provide the initial data memory values and the instructions. Please open the report to see the tables of how it should be formatted. The tables should be on the Appendix.
